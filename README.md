## Abstract:

In mammalian genomes, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and histone marks including H3K27me3 at imprinted genes are asymmetrically inherited to control parentallybiased gene expression. However, neither parent-of-origin-specific transcription nor imprints have been comprehensively mapped at the blastocyst stage of preimplantation development. We here address this by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches in mouse preimplantation embryos. Seventy-one genes exhibited novel parentof-origin-specific expression in blastocysts (nBiX: novel blastocyst-imprinted expressed). Uniparental nBiX expression disappeared soon after implantation. Micro-whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (ÂµWGBS) of individual uniparental blastocysts detected 859 DMRs. Only 16% of nBiXs were associated with a DMR, whereas most were associated with, and/or dependent on, parentally-biased H3K27me3, indicating a major role for Polycomb-mediated imprinting in blastocysts. nBiX genes were clustered: five clusters contained at least one published imprinted gene, and five novel clusters contained exclusively nBiX genes. These data suggest that early development undergoes a complex program of stage-specific imprinting involving different tiers of regulation.
